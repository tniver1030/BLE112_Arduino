What
---------
This project is the source code for the RememBring Host. (http://RememBring.com)
The project uses the BLE112 Chip to check for nearby blueototh 'beacons'. If a beacon
that is registered is missing, the device alerts the user through a series of beeps and
through a flashing LED. This prevents users from forgetting important object upon starting
their car (breifcase, wallet, child).

Platfrom

Atmega328 (Arduino Micro)
BLE112 

Dependencies
---------
AltSoftSerial Library
BGLib
